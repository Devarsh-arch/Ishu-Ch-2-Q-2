<p>The websites of other schools are very well organised. When you see their websites there are so many options to see. Every page is connected to each other so you don't have to go back to see a new page.The page is also very colourful and we can see the pictutres of their school in the home page too. Overall, their websites are very good and the colour combination is also good.</p>
